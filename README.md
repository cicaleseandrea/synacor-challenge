# Synacor Challenge

I had a lot of fun solving the [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com).

I recommend you to do the same *before reading the code*, to avoid **spoilers**.

If you want to just play, run the program and keep in mind that:
- you can save your progress by typing `save <file name>`
- you can load your progress by typing `load <file name>`
- the teleporter puzzle will be solved automatically ðŸ¤· (you can read [this file](src/main/resources/decodedTeleporterFunction.txt) to understand what's happening ðŸ¤”)
- the orb puzzle _can_ be solved automatically: just type `solve orb` immediately after taking the orb
